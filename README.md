# typeracer-bot-selenium
Python selenium bot to type in nitrotype.

I came back to this ideia. instead of using a image recognition software, I learned about selenium and web scrapping.

This approach was a lot easier, simplier and less heavy than the other one.
Thinking about make the bot do typos too look more human, probably with the random library. I would add a certain chance
to miss the letter.

Thanks for reading, have a nice day.
